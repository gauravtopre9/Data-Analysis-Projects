## Objective 

Google Play Store team is about to launch a new feature where in certain apps that are promising are boosted in visibility. The boost will manifest in multiple ways – higher priority in recommendations sections (“Similar apps”, “You might also like”, “New and updated games”). These will also get a boost in visibility in search results.  This feature will help bring more attention to newer apps that have potential. 

The task is to understand what makes an app perform well - size? price? category? multiple factors together? Analyze the data and present your insights in a format consumable by business – the ﬁnal output of the analysis would be presented to business as insights with supporting data/visualizations.
